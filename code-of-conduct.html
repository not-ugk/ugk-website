    <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>Everyone participating in the UGK community is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes
        all attendees, speakers, performers, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.</p>
    <p>UGK is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity
        and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race,
        ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
    <p>Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the
        UGK organizers.</p>
    <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
    <p>Harassment includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental
            illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion</li>
        <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food,
            health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
        <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>
        <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
        <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without
            consent or after a request to stop</li>
        <li>Threats of violence</li>
        <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage
            in self-harm</li>
        <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
        <li>Stalking or following</li>

        <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
        <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
            others</li>
        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to
            protect other UGK community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse</li>
        <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>UGK prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. UGK reserves the right not to act
        on complaints regarding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
        <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this
            with you.”</li>
        <li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
        <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, UGK may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including
        expulsion from all UGK spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other UGK community members
        or the general public.</p>
    <h2 id="reporting-and-enforcement">Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
