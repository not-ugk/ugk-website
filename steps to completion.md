### PRETTIFY

- fix formatting of some names (ampersands)
- add manual fix for acdc for now
- make return work on phones (replace button with form probably)
- make search text box bigger on phones
- make background of searchbox darker
- make prettier
- replace red with velvet

### MODERNIZE

- install mochajs for testing (and configure with node)
- checkout typescript?

- running eslint?
- installing and running preffify?
- package-lock.json?

- install babel and babelify
- configue babel
- make seperate bundles for data and js scripts
- change mustache generation to make a json file instead
- include data file in data bundle
- remove search.js from gitignore and remove old mustache template
- get everything building locally
- fix github actions
- merge and publish

- add maskito for masking (literally the entire purpose is doing all of this) and see if I can use the post-processor for a side-effect (updating the search results), or, at minimum, use the key handling to do the search upon hitting return
